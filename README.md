# Security Measures
This app incorporates several security measures to ensure the safety of user data:

Helmet Middleware: The app uses the Helmet middleware to set various security-related HTTP headers, helping to protect against common web vulnerabilities.

CORS: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is configured to control which domains are allowed to make requests to the server, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

Favorites Management: When adding items to the favorites list, the app checks for duplicate entries to prevent redundancy.

API Key Handling: The app does not require API keys since it uses a publicly accessible iTunes Search API. If you intend to use other APIs, make sure to follow best practices for API key management.
